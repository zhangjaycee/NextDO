# NextDO
I hope a CLI tool provide both essantial features and easy way to use to manage my daily time, so this small project was born...


## What it is:
NextDO is a CLI planning tool. You can add, check or delete things you should do next few hours or days of daily work & life.


## How to use it:
It is just a Python program, and it will generate a json formatted file for persistent storage when executing.


## (it is now under developing....)
now avaliable functions:
* Basic operations (create, check, delete items and views)
* Data persistence (save to or load from a JSON format file)
